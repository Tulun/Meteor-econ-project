<h1>Econ data visualization project using D3 and Meteor.</h1>

The goal of this project will have one main objective:

To take a dataset or two I like and render interesting economic data in D3.

The secondary goal after I finish the main one will be to allow the user to upload any dataset and build their own charts. This will depend on how much time I have.

The code may never be production ready but a proof of concept (so I may not remove autopublish and such. Keep that in mind).

The upload template I used follows this blog post:

I got the data for Democrat/Republican demographics from New York Times Entrance/Exit polls (and may therefore reflect some inaccuracies), with some stats spliced from other news sources (NBC, etc).
